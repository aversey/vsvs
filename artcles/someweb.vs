 This operator can be used on a quotation or a dictionary:<br />
 If a quotation quot is passed, it returns a new quotation
 obtained by evaluating each element of quot in a separate stack.<br />
 If a dictionary dict (with values and keys) is passed,
 it returns a new dictionary obtained by evaluating each value
 in the dict that is a symbol in a separate stack
 (values that arenâ€™t symbols stay as they are).
