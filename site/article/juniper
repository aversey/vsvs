 of the cypress family Cupressaceae.
 Depending on taxonomic viewpoint, between 50 and 67 species of junipers are
 widely distributed throughout the Northern Hemisphere, from the Arctic,
 south to tropical Africa, from Ziarat, Pakistan, east to eastern Tibet
 in the Old World, and in the mountains of Central America.
